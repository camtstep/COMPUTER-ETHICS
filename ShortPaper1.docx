Short Paper 1
	An issue that garners more attention with each passing year and its effects felt more frequently with each passing day has become the most important issue facing society according to 56% of American adults (Science Daily). The issue, unsurprisingly, is climate change – the shifting of the global climate caused by human activity that is pumping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and are causing the global average temperature to steadily increase. This increase in average temperature is already starting to wreak havoc across the globe in the form of extreme weather events and the loss of entire species of animals. Unfortunately, these events are just the beginning of a new normal. 
Many large corporations are culprits in the continued stream of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and are doing so in the name of profits. Like many other issues, the lower class feels the effects of climate change disproportionately more than other groups. Poor island nations are frequently being thrashed by cyclones and droughts around the world effect the food supplies for poverty-stricken communities who depend on the land for nourishment. As humanity grapples with the issue and how to combat it, ethical concerns start to arise. I will use subjective relativism and divine command theory as a lens to view some of these concerns.
Subjective relativism states that there is no universal right and wrong and what is right to one person may be wrong to another. Regarding climate change, we can illustrate this theory by looking at how an executive at an oil company might view climate change and the way a typical citizen looks at the issue. An executive most likely has their position because they put the company first and help to generate profits. Therefore, an executive would say making money at the expense of the environment is good because it brings them and their employees and shareholders prosperity financially. On the other hand, a typical citizen would say that making money at the expense of the climate is bad because it is harming all of humanity. This theory leaves a broad range of what is considered right and wrong and is not a good theory to use when closely examining an issue such as climate change.
	Divine command theory says that good actions align with God’s will and that God’s will can be found in Holy books. Holy books say to take care of the Earth and to be good stewards of it for the most part. There are certain scriptures that can be taken out of context but for the most part Holy books say to take care of the Earth. This theory, like subjective relativism, is not a good theory to use when examining climate change. Holy books were written thousands of years ago and did not have the scientific knowledge that we know today.
	Subjective relativism skews from my beliefs about the ethics of climate change. Climate change should be one of the top priorities we as a species should be handling. There should be no room in the discussion for whether propagating greenhouse gases is good or not. There is no good in exacerbating climate change. In the long run everyone and all future generations will be affected negatively by a warming planet. My view falls more in line with the divine command theory. I am not a religious person but I do agree with treating the planet with respect. The two theories I used to discuss the ethics of climate change are interesting lens to view the issue through but should not be the definitive ones used. Ethics offers many other theories that can help humanity in the fight in how to properly combat climate change.
