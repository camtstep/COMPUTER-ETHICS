Short Paper 2
	Netflix’s documentary “The Social Dilemma” explores the nature of social media and how these platforms are designed to be addictive to engage users. The amount of time scrolling is tracked to better understand a user’s online behavior. Advertisements are personalized. Push notifications are sent to draw a user back in. These are some of the tactics used to reenforce the addictive nature of Instagram, Twitter, and the likes. 
	One theory that helps to understand whether or not social media’s addictive nature is beneficial to society is Act Utilitarianism. This theory states that something is beneficial if its benefits outweigh its harms. Benefits can be equated to advantage, happiness, good, and pleasure while harms can be equated to disadvantage, unhappiness, evil, and pain. Some of the benefits of social media mentioned in the documentary are:
•	Staying in touch with family and friends
•	Access to unprecedented amounts of knowledge and information
•	Ability to capture your target audience
There are disadvantages, however.
•	Personal data being sold
•	Self-image issues more frequent
•	Social media being used to undermine democracy
•	Ability to be manipulated by bad actors
All of these pros and cons coupled with the addictive nature of the social media platforms have the ability to manipulate people at a psychological level. However, this does not make them necessarily bad if one views the issue with Act Utilitarianism. This theory is dependent on what someone considers a benefit and what they consider a harm. Social media addiction is harmful if it is affecting a user’s life negatively on the whole. Self-image issues would be harmful with this theory. On the benefit side, social media gives users access to friends and family that previous generations could not imagine. Also, humans crave knowledge and social media provides that which can be seen as a benefit.
With all the information given, lets assume using Act Utilitarian that social media addiction is at a median point on the spectrum between harm and benefit for society. Despite the benefits, the harms will start to outweigh the benefits if more regulation is not put in place. More transparency needs to be put in place so people know where their information is coming from and who stands to gain from the spread of the information. Young people need to understand that social media only offers a glimpse into someone’s life and not the whole picture. Social media, even with its addictiveness, can be used as a force for good with the right changes and understanding.
